Things to do:

50 trials (eventually > 100) @ each of 3 different heights (0, r, 2r, 3r, ... ?)

50 trials (eventually > 100) @ varying payloads (0g, 150g, 300g)

Different speeds: (0m/s, 0.5m/s, 1m/s); Do 0m/s first and use results to evaluate if we want to do 0.5m/s or greater

For future info:
- Consider yaw of robot (45 deg might be better)
- Use a better robot w/ slightly larger markers (or fix up Kilo)
- Consider further from ground effect (4r, 5r?)
- Use diagonal instead of moving along x axis
- Better safety catches
  - Hover if too many frames drop
  - Eland if even more drop
- Pause (~1s) at beginning of each IGE and OGE segment
- Pub an int for constant velocity segments (perhaps pass in like gains through the trajectory) 0 normally, 1 IGE, 2 OGE
- Keep an eye on radio connection since there were some dropouts
- Payload
- Share experimental setup
- Model to predict stabilty in ground effect (think springs under each motor)
